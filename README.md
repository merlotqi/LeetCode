# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains solutions to LeetCode problems in multiple programming languages. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific language and contains solutions implemented in that language.

## Structure

- `C/` — Solutions in C
- `CPlusPlus/` — Solutions in C++
- `Java/` — Solutions in Java
- `JavaScript/` — Solutions in JavaScript
- `Kotlin/` — Solutions in Kotlin
- `Python/` — Solutions in Python
- `Rust/` — Solutions in Rust
- `Swift/` — Solutions in Swift
- `TypeScript/` — Solutions in TypeScript

Each language folder contains files named after the LeetCode problem, typically in the format `<problem_number>.<problem-title>.<extension>`, e.g., `1.two-sum.cpp`.

## How to Use

1. Browse to the folder of your preferred programming language.
2. Find the solution file for the problem you are interested in.
3. Each file contains a self-contained solution to the corresponding LeetCode problem.
